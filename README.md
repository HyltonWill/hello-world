My name is Hylton Williamson. I am a computer science major at the University of Central Florida.
I have beginner experience with C, Java, and HTML. What I like most about programming is the challenge
of figuring out how to the program to do what you want. At my current experience level most assignments
are a bit like puzzles that need quite a bit of time to figure out, but once you do, the feeling of
accomplishment is amazing. The hardest thing about programming for me is my ignorance of the languages
and all the tools available to get the a project or assignment done.
